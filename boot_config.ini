# Each key can be defined using a section, like the example below. 'path'
# is the path to the .3dsx file, while delay is a number (in nanoseconds)
# to delay the application boot.
# Why this is important? This may improve the booting of some homebrews
# (e.g. CFWs).

# You don't even need to define delay. If so, it will use the default.
[KEY_L]

# You don't even need to define a path. Defining only the delay will boot
# the default option with an alternative delay. Don't know if this makes
# any sense, though.
