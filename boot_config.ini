# Default is the option that is used if you don't press anything.
# [DEFAULT]
# path = /boot_default.3dsx
# delay = 100

# Each key can be defined using a section, like the example below. 'path'
# is the path to the .3dsx file, while delay is a number (in microseconds)
# to delay the application boot.
# Why this is important? This may improve the booting of some homebrews
# (e.g. CFWs).
[KEY_R]
path = /boot_1.3dsx
# delay = 0

# You don't even need to define delay. If so, it will use the default.
# [KEY_L]
# path = /boot_2.3dsx

# You don't even need to define a path. Defining only the delay will boot
# the default option with an alternative delay. Don't know if this makes
# any sense, though.
# [KEY_A]
# delay = 250

# Valid keys:
# KEY_A, KEY_B, KEY_SELECT, KEY_START, KEY_UP, KEY_DOWN, KEY_LEFT, KEY_RIGHT,
# KEY_R, KEY_L, KEY_ZL (N3DS only), KEY_ZR (N3DS only).
# Directional keys (like KEY_UP) counts both to D-pad  and circle pad.
